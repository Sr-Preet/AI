    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Collatz Conjecture</h2>
    <p>
        The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with
        any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is
        even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the
        previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
